						<h1>Week 1 Discussion Question</h1>
						<h2>Industry Research and Project Intent</h2>
						<h3>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</h3>
							<p>The PhoneGap chart illustrates the supported features.  The features include accelerometer, camera, compass, contacts, file, 
								geolocation, media, network, notifications, and storage.
							</p>
					
						<h3>For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?</h3>
							<p>	For the application I am currently working on, "Beer Lager", I would like to implement many of these features.  I would like 								to have the	ability to access the camera to take a picture of the beer.  Geolocation could be used to have it record where 									the beer was obtained. Contacts and notifications could be used to send a recommended beer to a friend, and the app will 									notify you when a friend as sent you a beer.
							</p>
					
						<h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
							<p>
								In the past I tend to go over board.  I have an idea of what I want the app to look like in my head and the way it will work.  								The problem is my current knowledge and skill is not good enough to accomplish.  I tend to waste a lot of time trying to 									"shoot for the stars".  
							</p>	
								
						<h3>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
							<p>
								I hope to finalize the design of the Beer Lager app in AVF.  I would like both apps to have some uniqueness to the 											application that seperates it from other apps. 
							</p>
							
						<h3>If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/								new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
							<p>See Above</p>

						<h1>Week 2 Discussion Question</h1>
						<h2>Industry Research and Project Intent</h2>
						<h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the 								Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h3>
								<p>Since my CRUD app is about logging in beer, I would make sure that the app is accessible to those that are drunk.  										One way to accomplish this would be to make sure buttons are spaced far apart so a user would no accidentally click on 										something when motor skills have been impaired.</p>
						<h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of 							the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them 								(or use them)?</h3>
							<p>	First let me point out, the firs thing these screen reader companies need is better demos.  That being said, it is hard for 								me to really imagine being blind and not being able to see what is on the screen.  As a developer I could make sure that my 								applications interface with those screen readers.  Not only will this increase my audience of users to those perhaps my 									competition has not considered, but I will have made someone's life that much easier.
							</p>
					
						<h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Benheck's Access Controller</br>
									The "Access" Controller is an Xbox360 Controller designed for those who only have one hand.  The controller is of modular 									design so you can move the elements (d=pad, joystick, buttons, etc..) to any location.  
								</li></br>
								<li>iPad Mounting System</br>
									The iPad Mounting System is an easy to use device that clamps on to a wheel chair or motorized chair.  The mount hold the 									iPad in a custom case that eases the use of the device for those with the lack of motor skills.  
								</li></br>
							</ul>	
						<h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
							<ul>	
								<li>iComm</br>
									Initially designed for children under three.  This application uses pictures and words so a person who has trouble 											communicating through words can express themselves.  Helpful for those with cerebral palsy or autism.</li></br>
								<li>iSpectrum Color Blind Assistant</br>
									iSpectrum is a photo app for those who are color blind.  You take a picture of the item you would like to identify, click 									on that part of the picture and the application gives you a spectrum and name of the color selected.  
								</li></br>
							</ul>
