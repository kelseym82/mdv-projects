	<h1>Week 1 Discussion Question</h1>
	<h2>Industry Research and Project Intent</h2>
	<h3>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</h3>
		<p>
			The PhoneGap chart illustrates the supported features.  The features include accelerometer, camera, compass, contacts, file, 
			geolocation, media, network, notifications, and storage.
		</p>

	<h3>For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?</h3>
		<p>
			For the application I am currently working on, "Beer Lager", I would like to implement many of these features.  I would like to have the 			ability to access the camera to take a picture of the beer.  Geolocation could be used to have it record where the beer was obtained.  				Contacts and notifications could be used to send a recommended beer to a friend, and the app will notify you when a friend as sent you a 			beer.
		</p>

	<h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
		<p>
			In the past I tend to go over board.  I have an idea of what I want the app to look like in my head and the way it will work.  The 					problem is my current knowledge and skill is not good enough to accomplish.  I tend to waste a lot of time trying to "shoot for the 				stars".  
		</p>	
			
	<h3>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
		<p>
			I hope to finalize the design of the Beer Lager app in AVF.  I would like both apps to have some uniqueness to the application that 				seperates it from other apps. 
		</p>
		
	<h3>If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of 		your CRUD app.</h3>
		<p>See Above</p>
